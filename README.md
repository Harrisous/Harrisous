### <Jan-Aug 2023> **APSAP Automation Application**, the University of Hong Kong 
  - Category: Education, Automation
  - This project was a sub-project of HKU [𝐀𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐒𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐞𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭](https://www.instagram.com/apsap.armenia/), aiming to streamline and automate the data collection and processing during archeological activities. Detailed information could be found in [APSAP repo](https://github.com/LordUky/APSAP-undergraduate-research). 

## Course Project Highligts
### Duke AIPI590-1 Large Language Model (LLM)
- [Duke Chatbot - Blue Devil Bot](https://github.com/Harrisous/AIPI590LLM-project-2-DukeChatbot).   
A chatbot for Duke related information retrieval, built using LangGraph framework for agentic search. Toolbox includes: API calls for exisitng APIs, Web Scrapping, and Tavily search for general search. WebScraping(bs4), LangGraph, Agentic Search, API are the key technologies used in this project.
- [LLM Text-To-SQLs Fintuning](https://github.com/Duke-AIPI-LLM-Course/project-1-maiga).   
A large language model (LLM) fine-tuning task using the Bird database, aimed at enhancing LLM's capabilities in automatic text-to-SQL generation. We achieved 50% accuracy improvement on simple Text-To-SQL generation tasks at the expense of the capability to deal with challenging tasks. Benchmark source: [BIRD-SQL: A BIg Bench for Large-Scale Relational Database Grounded Text-to-SQLs](https://www.benchflow.ai/benchmarks/benchflow/Bird). Unsloth, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) including LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) were used in the project.

### Duke AIPI590-10 AI in Physical World
- [Group Project - AIPet (Pido)](https://github.com/Harrisous/AIPI590AIPhysicialWorld-AIPet).   
Our team built an AI pet robot that can follow the owner's commands with tracking function, providing comfort and companionship to the user. The pet is able to move or follow the user, understand instruction bark, show emotion on LCD screen and wag tail. The whole system runs on a RaspberryPi 4B powered by a powerbank and the action are done by motors (powered by another set of batteries) and servo. [Presentation url](https://gamma.app/docs/AIPI590-AI-in-Physical-World-Final-Project-s5tkqa21zyp9gwf?mode=doc). Key technologies used: sensor integration, GPIO control, speech recognition, computer vision, motor and servo control.  
- [Driving behavior detector](https://github.com/Harrisous/AIPI590PhysicalMidterm).   
An individual project on raspberrypi 4B with traditional ML model to detect user's driving behavior via acceleration and gyroscope reading and predict the driver's behavior from a trained model. [Presenttaion URL](https://gamma.app/docs/DriveGuard-Enhancing-Road-Safety-with-AI-bifr11u9z5t2xvz?mode=doc)

### Duke AIPI540 Deep Learning
- [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Harrisous/Duke_25Sprint_AIPI540_Module3_Recommendation-Systems) This project implements an advanced hybrid recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations to users. The system leverages both user behavior data and descriptive content to create a robust recommendation engine that addresses cold-start problems and provides explainable recommendations.  
- [Stock Market Transformer](https://github.com/Harrisous/StockMarketTransformer) Stock Market Transformer is a deep learning project for stock market prediction using autoencoder-based environment embeddings and Transformer (with Mixture-of-Experts and multi-head attention) to forecast future prices from complex time-series market data. The approach delivered promising short-term opening price prediction results with a working app, though further improvements are needed for broader targets and lower loss.  
- [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Harrisous/AIPI540A2) A project containing different sentiment analysis methods.
